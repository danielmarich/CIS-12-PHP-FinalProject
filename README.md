# CIS-12-PHP-FinalProject
This is the final project for my CIS-12 PHP Dynamic Web Site Programming class at MVC.
The php project premise is a comic book manager for comic book collectors to keep track of their personal comic book collection that is to be run within a brower environment. 
It is written to connect to a MySQL database, conduct form validation, and allows the user to add, edit, and delete their comic book entries.
